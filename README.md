# National Theatre of Kosovo Webpage Project

This project is a webpage developed for the **National Theatre of Kosovo**, designed to provide information about performances, events, and ticket bookings. The project started with a focus on front-end development and was later enhanced with back-end functionality and database integration.

## Project Overview

The project was developed as part of two university courses:

- **Programming in the Web 1**: The initial version of the webpage focused on front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Programming in the Web 2**: The project was further enhanced with back-end technologies including PHP, a database, AJAX, and more.
